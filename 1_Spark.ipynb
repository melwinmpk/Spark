    "So, the Spark ecosystem is designed in two layers.<br>\n",
    "The bottom layer is the Spark Core Layer.<br>\n",
    "Then we have the next layer, a set of DSLs, libraries, and APIs.<br>\n",
    "These two things together make the Spark ecosystem.<br>\n",
    "The Spark core layer itself has got two parts.<br>\n",
    "A distributed Computing Engine And a set of core APIs<br>\n",
    "And this whole thing runs on a cluster of computers to offer you distributed data processing.<br>\n",
    "However, Spark does not manage the cluster.<br>\n",
    "It only gives you a data processing framework.<br>\n",
    "So, you are going to need a cluster manager.<br>\n",
    "People use different names for Cluster Manager, such as Resource Manager or the Container Orchestrator.<br>\n",
    "However, they all offer similar services to Spark, and Spark is designed to work with both.<br>\n",
    "Spark was initially based on Hadoop MR, and it was adopted in the Hadoop platform.<br>\n",
    "So, the Hadoop YARN resource manager is the most commonly used cluster manager for Spark.<br>\n",
    "However, you have other options, such as Mesos and Spark Standalone Cluster Manager.<br>\n",
    "The newer versions of Spark are also compatible with Kubernetes as a Cluster Orchestrator.<br>\n",
    "Similarly, Spark also doesn't come with an in-built storage system.<br>\n",
    "And it allows you to process the data, which is stored in a variety of storage systems.<br>\n",
    "The most popular and commonly used storage systems are<br>\n",
    "HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure Data Lase Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and the Cassandra file system.<br>\n",
    "So, one thing is obvious.<br>\n",
    "Apache Spark does not offer Cluster Management and Storage Management.<br>\n",
    "All you can do with Apache Spark is to run your data processing workload.<br>\n",
    "And that part is managed by the Spark Compute Engine.    <br>\n",
    "So the compute engine is responsible for a bunch of things.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, breaking your data processing work into smaller tasks,<br>\n",
    "scheduling those tasks on the cluster for parallel execution, providing data to these tasks,<br>\n",
    "managing and monitoring those tasks, provide you fault tolerance when a job fails.<br>\n",
    "And to do all these,<br>\n",
    "the core engine is also responsible for interacting with the cluster manager and the data storage manager.<br>\n",
    "So the Spark compute engine is the core that runs and manages your data processing work<br>\n",
    "and provides you with a seamless experience.<br>\n",
    "All you need to do is submit your data processing jobs to Spark, <br>\n",
    "and the Spark core will take care of everything else.<br>\n",
    "Now let's move a level up.<br>\n",
    "The second part of the Spark Core<br>\n",
    "The Core APIs.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>This layer is the programming interface layer that offers you the core APIs in four major languages.</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Scala,</li>\n",
    "<li>Java,</li>\n",
    "<li>Python,</li>\n",
    "<li>and R programming language.</li>\n",
    "</ul>    \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the APIs that we used to write data processing logic during the initial days of Apache Spark.<br>\n",
    "However, these APIs were based on resilient distributed datasets (RDD).<br>\n",
    "These APIs can offer you the highest level of flexibility to solve some complex data processing problems. (at present Dataframes are recommended over Rdd's)<br>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "So, you will be using these top-level APIs and DSLs.<br>\n",
    "But internally, all of those will be using Spark Core APIs, and ultimately things will go to the Spark Compute Engine.<br>\n",
    "The topmost API layer is grouped into four categories to support four different data processing requirements.<br>\n",
    "However, this is just a logical grouping, and there is no rigid boundary.<br>\n",
    "Things are going to overlap in most of the real-life projects.<br>\n",
    "The first group is a set of two things.<br>\n",
    "Spark SQL and then Spark DataFrame/Dataset APIs<br>\n",
    "Spark SQL allows you to use SQL queries to process your data.<br>\n",
    "So that part is quite simple for those who already know SQL.<br>\n",
    "Spark DataFrame/DataSet will allow you to use functional programming techniques<br>\n",
    "to solve your data crunching problems.<br>\n",
    "These APIs are available in Java, Scala, and Python.<br>\n",
    "Both of these together can help you resolve most of the structured and semistructured data crunching problems.<br>\n",
    "The next one is Spark Streaming libraries,<br>\n",
    "and they allow you to process a continuous and unbounded stream of data<br>\n",
    "Then you have a set of libraries specifically designed to meet your machine learning,<br>\n",
    "deep learning, and AI requirements.<br>\n",
    "The last collection is for Graph Processing libraries,<br>\n",
    "and they allow you to implement Graph Processing Algorithms using Apache Spark.<br>\n",
    "So the topmost layer is nothing but a set of libraries and DSLs to help you solve your data crunching problems.<br>\n",
    "And all these are available in multiple languages such as Java, Scala, Python, and R.<br>\n",
